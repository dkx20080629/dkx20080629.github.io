        <h2>Step 1: find a dataset</h2>
        <p><a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/">universe roboflow</a>&nbspis a flexible, open-source platform that combines the power of artificial intelligence with robotics. It simplifies complex tasks like motion planning, object detection, and sensor integration.You can also find the datatsets on the websites.</p>
        <p1>How to choose a good dataset?</p1>
        <p>• find a dataset which fit your project goal (i.e. object detection, classification)</p>
        <p>• make sure datatset is support the model</p>
        <p>• check the data quality, relvance, diversity</p>
